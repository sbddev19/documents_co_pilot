Would you like me to include a Gantt-style visual timeline (chart) or a tabular sprint plan with tasks, owners, and dependencies (Excel-ready) for presentation or PMO reporting? I can generate either format next.

Please confirm which format(s) you‚Äôd like me to generate (you can choose both if needed):
	1.	üìä Gantt Chart (PDF or Image) ‚Äì a visual project timeline showing each sprint, testing phase, and go-live milestone.
	2.	üìÖ Detailed Sprint Plan (Excel) ‚Äì week-by-week breakdown with columns like Sprint, Start Date, End Date, Tasks, Owner, Deliverables, Dependencies, and Status.

Also confirm:
	‚Ä¢	Do you want the project start date fixed as October 13, 2025 and go-live as November 22, 2025 (as per earlier plan)?
	‚Ä¢	Should I include resource effort allocation (in hours per week) for each role in the Excel file?

Once you confirm these, I‚Äôll generate the Gantt chart and/or Excel plan accordingly.
