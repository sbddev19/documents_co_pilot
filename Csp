Based on the CORS headers shown in your screenshots, there is a medium risk CORS misconfiguration due to overly permissive settings, especially when Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true is combined with flexible or reflected origins. Here’s a breakdown and the solution:

⸻

🔍 Identified Issues
	1.	Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://nccgroup.com
	•	While this is a specific domain (good), if it’s dynamically reflecting the Origin header without validation, it poses a risk.
	•	If the origin is reflected based on a request (i.e., attacker-controlled), this allows credentialed requests from malicious domains.
	2.	Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
	•	Allows cookies and HTTP authentication to be sent with cross-origin requests.
	•	Combined with dynamic Access-Control-Allow-Origin, it becomes a serious issue.
	3.	Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, Cookie, country
	•	This includes sensitive headers like Authorization and Cookie—acceptable only for highly trusted and validated origins.
	4.	Access-Control-Expose-Headers and token exposure:
	•	ACCESS-TOKEN, CSL-REFRESH-TOKEN being exposed makes it easy for attackers to obtain sensitive tokens.

✅ Recommended Solutions

1. Avoid dynamic Access-Control-Allow-Origin when using credentials
	•	Set the header only to a strict whitelist of trusted domains.

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://trusted-client.example.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true


Do not use "*" when Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.

2. Do not expose sensitive headers unless necessary
	•	Review and remove sensitive headers from Access-Control-Expose-Headers.
	•	Example:


Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length

•	Avoid exposing ACCESS-TOKEN and CSL-REFRESH-TOKEN unless absolutely required.

3. Restrict Access-Control-Allow-Headers
	•	Limit to only what’s needed:

Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type

•	Avoid including Authorization, Cookie, etc., unless required and the origin is trusted.

4. Implement origin validation logic on the server
	•	Example in Node.js (Express):


const allowedOrigins = ['https://trusted-client.example.com'];
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  const origin = req.headers.origin;
  if (allowedOrigins.includes(origin)) {
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', origin);
    res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
  }
  next();
});

5. Set strict Content-Security-Policy
	•	Improve frontend security with proper CSP headers:

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';
