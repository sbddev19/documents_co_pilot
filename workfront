The Workfront Release Enablement is a technical change within the existing Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) production environment aimed at activating the Workfront integration feature, which has already been deployed but remains in a disabled state. This release does not introduce new components or code changes; rather, it focuses on toggling the configuration and enabling the feature flag to make the functionality live for end users. The activation ensures seamless connectivity between AEM and Adobe Workfront, allowing content teams to efficiently manage and publish assets, tasks, and workflows directly through the unified Adobe platform. All validations and regression testing have been completed in lower environments to ensure a smooth and risk-free enablement in production.

The solution intent for this release is common across both environments and has been reviewed and approved by all relevant stakeholders. The objective is to enable the Workfront integration feature within the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) production instance, which is already live but currently inactive. This change involves activating the pre-deployed configuration to make the functionality available to business users, ensuring alignment with the overall Adobe platform strategy. No new code deployment is required, and the activation has been validated through successful testing in lower environments. This step completes the approved implementation plan and enables seamless collaboration between AEM and Workfront in production.
